- User-Friendly Interface: Clean UI with a hero section for quick scans and detailed results display.
- PDF Reports: Download comprehensive security reports in PDF format using jsPDF.
- SEO Optimized: Configured with metadata for search engines and social media sharing.
- Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS and Nunito Sans font for a polished, mobile-friendly experience.
- Next.js Powered: Leverages server-side rendering and client components for performance and interactivity.
- Theme Support: Light/dark mode toggle with next-themes.

## Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scanly.git
cd scanly


Install Dependencies:
npm install


Set Up Environment:Create a .env.local file in the root directory and add any necessary environment variables (e.g., API endpoints if applicable):
# Example
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.yourwebsite.com


Run the Development Server:
npm run dev

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Build for Production:
npm run build
npm run start


## 🧠 Version 2 (Planned)
- Scan dependencies (npm audit / Snyk-like check)
- Detect outdated libraries
- Find secrets in code (e.g., API keys)
- Repository scanning support

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Enter a URL into the input box.
2. The frontend sends a request to your API route.
3. The backend fetches the headers and runs checks.
4. Results are displayed instantly.


## Results:

View a detailed breakdown of security headers, SSL/TLS, cookies, and exposed information.
Check the security score and recommendations for improving your website’s security.

## API Integration
The Scanner component makes a POST request to /api/scan with the URL to analyze. Ensure your backend API is set up to handle this request and return a ScanReport object with the following structure:
interface ScanReport {
  url: string;
  securityScore: number;
  headers: Record<string, boolean>;
  tls: {
    valid: boolean;
    issuer?: string;
    validFrom?: string;
    validTo?: string;
    daysRemaining?: number;
    error?: string;
  };
  cookies: Array<{
    name: string;
    httpOnly: boolean;
    secure: boolean;
    sameSite: string;
  }>;
  exposed: {
    serverHeader: string;
    robotsTxt: string[];
    sitemapExists: boolean;
    directoryListing: boolean;
    redirectedToHttps?: boolean;
    finalUrl?: string;
  };
}

## SEO and Social Sharing

Metadata: Configured in app/layout.tsx with OpenGraph and Twitter tags for optimal sharing.
Images: Place a 1200x630px og-logo.png in /public for social media previews.
